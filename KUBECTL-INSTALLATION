It is good to always control your cluster from another node or environment different from where the 
cluster is located by creating another node or server in any platform like aws and then install kubectl
inside the node via cli.
Also install aws cli in the node with its corrspond prerequisite like java, vim, zip, git, etc as show below.
Finally you can now create a .kube/config file in the new node  by mkdir .kube and then  vi .kube/config
Finally copy the kubeconfig file (in your rancher ) or amy other k8s cluster you like and paste the content inside 
the config file you created in the new node.
when you run  kubectl get nodes, you will see that k8s cluster can now be accessed via this new node.

#step 1

# install AWS CLI, unzip, wget
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install unzip wget -y
sudo curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip -o awscli-bundle.zip
sudo apt install unzip python -y
sudo unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

#Step 2 - Download the Kubectl binary

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

#Step 3 - Make the Kubectl binary executable

chmod +x kubectl


#Step 4 - Move Kubectl binary to PATH and the kubectl is fianlly installed in your new node.

sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin
