It is good to always control your cluster from another node or environment different from where the 
cluster is located by creating another node or server in any platform like aws and then install kubectl
inside the node via cli.
Also install aws cli in the node with its corrspond prerequisite like java, vim, zip, git, etc as show below.
Finally you can now create a .kube/config file in the new node  by mkdir .kube and then  vi .kube/config
Finally copy the kubeconfig file (in your rancher ) or amy other k8s cluster you like and paste the content inside 
the config file you created in the new node.
when you run  kubectl get nodes, you will see that k8s cluster can now be accessed via this new node.

# Step 1 - Download the Kubectl binary
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/releas

#Step 2 - Make the Kubectl binary executable
chmod +x kubectl
